# GMean
This project is to detect the appropriate number of clusters for K-mean method using Statistics Hypothesis Test and Gaussian Distribution.

The Gmeans.R is the G-Means algorithm I implemented.

### How to run the code
1. To run the code, first you have to set the directory to my current code file. 
2. And you can include source("Gmeans.R") at the top to use the G-means algorithm for your test case.
3. Also, you can run the main.R script.
